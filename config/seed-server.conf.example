# Gotham City Seed Server Configuration Example
#
# Copy this file to /etc/gotham-seed-server/seed-server.conf
# and modify the settings as needed.

# Network Configuration
port=12345
max_peers=500

# Cleanup and Maintenance
cleanup_interval_seconds=180
rate_limit_per_minute=60

# Data Directory
# Default: ~/.gotham-seed (for user installs) or /var/lib/gotham-seed (for system installs)
data_directory=/var/lib/gotham-seed

# Logging
verbose=false

# Security Notes:
# - The seed server should run on a dedicated server with minimal attack surface
# - Use a firewall to restrict access to only necessary ports
# - Monitor logs for abuse and adjust rate limiting as needed
# - Consider running multiple seed servers for redundancy
# - Regularly update the Tor package for security fixes

# Performance Tuning:
# - Increase max_peers for high-traffic networks
# - Decrease cleanup_interval_seconds for faster cleanup of inactive peers
# - Adjust rate_limit_per_minute based on expected network activity
# - Monitor system resources and adjust accordingly

# Example configurations for different deployment scenarios:

# Small Network (< 100 nodes):
# max_peers=100
# cleanup_interval_seconds=300
# rate_limit_per_minute=30

# Medium Network (100-1000 nodes):
# max_peers=500
# cleanup_interval_seconds=180
# rate_limit_per_minute=60

# Large Network (> 1000 nodes):
# max_peers=2000
# cleanup_interval_seconds=120
# rate_limit_per_minute=120
